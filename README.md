# Notes Application(React)

## Desctiption

This is new version of my application for creating notes, that had been developed by using React.

- #### Technologies
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - React

* #### App features

  There are three main components: options bar, menu and notes section.

  1. At the options bar you can open the menu, use searching notes bar and also change the mode (dark or light).

  2. Using the menu buttons you can switch between sections, there are also three: creating notes section, collection (as a certain folder) and recycle bin.

  3. In the creating Notes section you can input some text to add new Note. This object has some features, like editing, moving between sections and deleting as well. Notes ans RecycleBin sections have their own clearing features. In the Notes section you can delete all the notes (in the whole app).

  4. Using the search bar you can find needed note and do whatever you need, for example edit or replace this note.

* #### Deployment

  Also, try to use the version of this app with pure JavaScript: https://evgenii-buslaev.github.io/NotesApp/src

Thank you for checking the app out!

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
